# Mental-health-support-website
I created this website as part of a 5 week 'Web Development Basics' course ran by AND Digital.

I chose the topic of mental health as not only is it an important topic but my local area doesn't easily distinguish between the different avenues of support available.

The website consists of a main page which links 5 sub-pages. 

In order not to overwhlem the user with information, the main page consists of images and matching captions which can then be clicked to find more information.
