          Therapy provides a safe and confidential space for you to talk to a
          trained professional about your issues and concerns. Your therapist will
          help you explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviours so you can
          develop a better understanding of yourself and of others. </br> </br> A counsellor
          will not give you their opinions or advice or prescribe medication. They
          will help you find your own solutions – whether that’s making effective
          changes in your life or finding ways of coping with your problems. </br> </br>
          During a session, your therapist may take you through specific exercises designed to help with your problem, or you might have more general discussions about how you're feeling. What you talk about will vary depend on what you want help with and the therapist’s approach.
